Hello, welcome to our Capstone Project for our Cal Poly Fullstack Academy Cyber Bootcamp Course. The name of this project is Make and Break, created by Erik Besner, Melody Dawson, and Michael Cardinale. The purpose of this project is to be a test of skill and/or practice for those learning either cyber-security or hacking in general. To do this we simulated a virtual network where you, the hacker, attempt to obtain the all mighty Abry's coupon which grants a lifetime supply of free Abry's. You use multiple common hacking techniques to progress and escalate your way through the network until you finally reach the CEO who claims to be the owner of this coupon. To start this journey you must begin at this Google Drive folder containing mutliple necessary files explaining the details of this virtual network. This includes things like the 4 downloadable virtual boxes, the walkthrough, and the video explanation. Below is the link to the folder, good luck and happy hacking!
